Aldryn NewsBlog was created at `Divio AG <https://divio.ch/>`_ of ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland and is
released under a BSD licence.

Aldryn NewsBlog is compatible with Divio's `Aldryn <http://aldryn.com>`_ cloud-based `django CMS
<http://django-cms.org>`_ hosting platform, and therefore with any standard django CMS
installation. The additional requirements of an Aldryn application do not preclude its use with any
other django CMS deployment.

Divio is committed to Aldryn NewsBlog as a high-quality application that helps set standards for
others in the Aldryn/django CMS ecosystem, and as a healthy open source project.

Divio maintains overall control of the `Aldryn NewsBlog repository
<https://github.com/aldryn/aldryn-newsblog>`_.
